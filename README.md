Hi there, and welcome to my Github repository. 

My name is Torben Behmer, and this repository is host to some of my data science-y endeavors. 
For statistical programming purposes, I regularly rely on programs such as Stata, and R, but also Python and SQL. 
For each project, please make sure to check out the respective readme file so as to make sure you're aware of the goals of the project, my approach, and the software used.

If you have any questions for me regarding my projects, or interests, you can reach me at tbehmer@gmail.com.

Thank you for visiting, I hope you'll enjoy your visit to my repository.
